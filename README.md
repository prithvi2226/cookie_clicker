# cookie_clicker
A self automated cookie clicker python program using selenium. 
Using one the amazing features of selenium
ie = Action_Chains
The ActionChains implementation,

class selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains.ActionChains(driver)

ActionChains are a way to automate low level interactions such as mouse movements
, mouse button actions, key press, and context menu interactions.
This is useful for doing more complex actions like hover over and drag and drop.

When you call methods for actions on the ActionChains object, the actions are stored in a queue in the ActionChains object.
When you call perform(), the events are fired in the order they are queued up.

what does it really do>...
There is a website basically a game which allows you to click on the cookie manually
from which you get points points you earn to beat ...wait ill get you the wiki def:

"The user initially clicks on a big cookie on the screen, earning a single cookie per click. They can then spend cookies on purchasing assets such as "cursors" and "buildings", which will automatically produce cookies. Upgrades can improve the efficiency of clicks and buildings, and other mechanics lead to many other ways in which the user can earn cookies. Though the game has no ending,[1] it has hundreds of achievements, and users may aim to reach milestone numbers of cookies."

so without wastung time and stressing your fingers i could literally buil a bot that could do it for me.
ps : its not the same case for all the online browser games out there.
     soem of em can detect the bots and ban you from the website!
